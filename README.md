# Image Classification

This project was created as part of a student research project to create a CNN using Python. At the end, the CNN should be able to distinguish dog pictures from cat pictures. 

## Installation

To use the CNN, all image files must be copied to the "train" folder. In addition, the image name must contain the depicted animal. 

If the repository is taken over completely, the images are already available and the cnn.ipynb can be executed directly.

Alternatively, the dataset can be retrieved here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data

## Required packages
